<h3>SPOOKYLOOP 5000</h3>
<p>Brian Cohn, October 25, 2020</p>
<h1>Is it done already?</h1>
<p>Once you press run, render, or build, it can take a while.
    We all know this experience of idly waiting by the computer: you haphazardly delete emails, exasperate through the news, and otherwise keep yourself occupied while the computer is occupied. All-the-while, you're intermittently checking on your program. Nope—still not done. Maybe you're checking it from TeamViewer for the sixth time. Nope, still going. You're glued to the screen.
    When you're waiting on a progress bar you're just <strong>on hold</strong>. The indeterminism means the progress bar's estimate of when it'll be done is always wrong. Loops shouldn't control our lives—loops should enrich them!
</p><h4>Introducing: SPOOKYLOOP 5000</h4><p>Named because it's still on port 5000 and so insecure it'll scare you, SPOOKYLOOP 5000 is the intelligent mobile progress bar companion that you never knew you wanted. With the ease of mind it provides, you'll be able to take a short walk around the block, brew a cup of tea, or pick up a few pages of that book, all with the confidence that SPOOKYLOOP 5000 will intelligently and reliably keep you up to date. With a few copy-pastes and a phone scan, you can check progress on the go, set a trigger to ping you when it's 90% done, and even share the program progress to a friend. You can even use it with apps like Installers, Renderers, and other programs that you just need a 'done' notification for.</p>
